# punchx

A LAMP FULL STACK PROJECT


Punchx is a web version of the punchin and punchout system we use in offices

The user has an option of one time one device loggin. If he/she want to loggin from another device, they may have to contact the admin who has the previlage to re register the device set to the account.
The user has a one time personal details entry which they have to fill the first time they access the account. Only after then will they be able to avail the facilities provided.

The admin side has much more features like viewing the users punched in and out, deleting users, re-registering the devices for the required users and also the basic facility to set the userid and password for the user. Admin has the facility to view the logs of a particular searched user or all the users in the particular week.The logs are autodeleted every sundays while the last punch can be viewed using the filter. They also have the option to view the users punched in after 5:30 pm if the current time is later than that on the same day or 5:30 am. They can also view the users based on departments. The user details are printed for thes two filter options in case the admin may have to contact the users for an emergency.

The system is designed in a very  user friendly way that the user and the can access it even without any manuals (just with some common reading capabilities).
